# README for True University ID

## Overview

True University ID is an innovative Web3 project that offers a secure and verifiable identity solution for the academic community using blockchain technology. It enables the creation of non-transferable tokens containing specific information from universities. These tokens can serve as digital identity proofs for students and staff of universities. Once created, a token can only be deleted by the user themselves or by admins, ensuring a high level of control and security.

## Key Features

- **Non-transferable Tokens**: Creation of unique digital identities that are securely bound to an individual and cannot be transferred.
- **Blockchain-based Verification**: Use of blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity and immutability of identity proofs.
- **Privacy and Security**: Protection of privacy through secure storage of personal data on the blockchain.
- **Easy Accessibility**: Through a web application, users can easily manage and verify their digital identity.

## System Requirements

To use the True University ID project, the following requirements must be met:

- An internet connection.
- A compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for interacting with the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.
- A browser that supports Web3 interactions.

## Installation and Setup

### Smart Contract Deployment

The Smart Contract for True University ID is located in the `contract` folder of the project. Currently, the Smart Contract is deployed on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet. The precise steps for deployment are as follows:

1. **Prepare the Environment**: Ensure Node.js and npm are installed on your system. You will also need Truffle or a similar framework for deploying smart contracts.

2. **Configure Deployment Settings**: Configure your `truffle-config.js` or an equivalent configuration file to use the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.

3. **Deploy**: Execute the deployment process with the appropriate command (e.g., `truffle migrate --network mumbai`) to deploy the smart contract to the testnet.

### Using the Web Application

The prototype of the web application is accessible at the URL [https://true-id.vercel.app/](https://true-id.vercel.app/). Its use is as follows:

1. **Connect Wallet**: Connect your wallet to the web application to access its functionalities.

2. **Request Token**: Request a digital identity proof in the form of a token by providing the required university information.

3. **View Tokens**: After connecting your wallet, you can view and manage all the tokens that have been issued.
